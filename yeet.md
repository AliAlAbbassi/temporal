create a webapp, mobile compatible obviously, for manga reading!
make it super fucking nice

functional requirements
- needs to be able to fetch manga from different sources
- search for manga
- user persisted preferences, reading progres, and user library

non functional requirements
- insane world class image decoding
- the images need to show up super crisp
- manga panels should take the entire screen
- nice and intuitive hud
- super fast loading
- cheap db (using it for myself for now)

research this stuff
